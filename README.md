# Home-Price-Prediction
The data science project entails creating a website for predicting real estate prices.The first step is to create a model with sklearn and linear regression on the Bangalore house prices dataset from kaggle.com. The second step would be to create a python flask server that serves http requests using the saved model. Then, website developed in html, css, and javascript that allows users to enter information such as home square footage, bedrooms, and so on, and then calls a python flask server to obtain the estimated price. Almost all data science topics, including as data load and cleaning, outlier identification and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tuning, k fold cross validation, and so on, are encountered during model construction. This project includes, in terms of technology and tools : 

1. Python 
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
